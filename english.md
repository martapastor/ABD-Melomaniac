The main goal of this practice is the development of a messaging website for music lovers. Several levels of specification are possible:

## Level 1
* Website access through username and password.
* Type of shipment: from one to all.
* When the user enters the application, he/she must read all messages sent. He/She can also send messages.

## Level 2
* Type of shipment: One by one (personal message)
* When the user enters the application he/she must also read all personal messages. He/She can also send personal messages.

## Level 3
* There should be a user profile based on the preferred music type and age.
* Each group is defined by a type of music and a range of ages of its members.
* With this information an administrator (through a separate web page) must be able to register groups.
* When the user enters the application he/she must also read all the messages addressed to the groups to which they belong. He/She can also send messages to those groups.
